Real-Time Infrared Detection Framework for Nocturnal Migratory Birds Using Spatiotemporal Anomaly Modeling


# NIGHTWING: Real-Time Infrared Detection Framework

## Project Description
This repository contains the code for our research project on detecting nocturnal migratory birds in thermal imagery to enhance aviation safety. We use a YOLO-NAS-S model trained on a limited thermal dataset, augmented with trajectory-based anomaly detection.

## Repository Structure
requirements.txt # List of Python dependencies

## Setup Instructions
1.  Open a Google Colab notebook (using our Pro account).
2.  Run: `!pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[YourUsername]/NIGHTWING/main/requirements.txt`
3.  Mount Google Drive: `from google.colab import drive; drive.mount('/content/drive')`
4.  Navigate to our project folder: `%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/[NIGHTWING]`

## Google Drive Structure
Our shared Drive folder `[NIGHTWING]` is organized as follows:
- `01-Datasets/` -> For all raw and processed data
- `02-Code/` -> For final scripts from this repo
- `03-Models/` -> For trained model weights (.pt files)
- `04-Training-Results/` -> For graphs, logs, output videos
- `05-Paper/` -> For paper drafts and figures

## Usage
// We will add this later as we create scripts.
